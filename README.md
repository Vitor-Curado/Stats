# Stats
Stats is an application aims to merge investment statistics (dividend yield, management costs, ACB, etc) with budgeting and purchase analysis, and possibly more. This originally came from a spreadsheet of mine wanting to put my finances in check and the data nerd in me couldn't withstand not collecting all my receipts and plugging it in the machine, when I started having a M:N relationship in my spreadsheet.

## Investments
Tracks investments accross all accounts one has

### Calculates net
Say you have multiple asset allocations spread through multiple accounts. Some assets yield dividends, others like BTC, gold and silver don't. This app aims to calculate net:
- Dividend yield
- Management expense ratios
- Price to earnings
- Beta
- Holdings (for example, for all the index funds invested, how many unique holdings is all of one's money in?)

Per account, or as far as per the entirety of one's portfolio.

### Calculates other factors
With information encompassing the entirety of one's financial life, one can start day dreaming about future life outcomes. For example, With a net dividend yield AND with either estimated or calculate cost of living data, one can calculate an investment target to cover cost of living. Not only that, one can calculate how much of {{person}}'s yearly cost of living is covered by their dividends

### Visuals
Graphs, graphs, graphs! Finance people love graphs, love seeing charts going up, pie charts of asset allocations, distributions. All of this can be calculated, produced very easily, in fact. These include:

- Pie charts for asset allocation % (both for individual accounts, and the entire portfolio)
- Registered/non-registered assets pie charts for grasping how one's money is sheltered
- Charts tracking deposits vs. portfolio value 

## Budgeting
Tracks expenses, raises awareness on how expensive some items are by individually tracking price to units (usually L or Kg). Many of us wouldn't buy a $110/kg beef tenderloin because the $/kg is usually written, but many of us would purchase a $98.04/kg protein bar if it weighs 0.04kg. Inputs is from the user manually typing product

### Tracking products
Tracks produt name, brand, quantity (Kg or L if applicable)
